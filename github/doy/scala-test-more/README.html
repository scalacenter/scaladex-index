  <pre>This library implements some of the more useful parts of the Test:: and TAP::
namespaces from Perl. Currently, we have:

- a class for writing tests (TestMore, similar to Test::More)
- a TAP generator (tap.TestBuilder, similar to Test::Builder)
- a TAP parser (tap.Parser, similar to TAP::Parser)
- a standalone test harness (harness.TestHarness, similar to Test::Harness)
- a harness which integrates into sbt

More features to come as requested!

This library is on the Maven Central Repository, as the artifact
com.iinteractive#scala-test-more_2.10;0.03

To use this library with your project, just add these two lines to your
build.sbt:

  libraryDependencies += "com.iinteractive" % "scala-test-more_2.10" % "0.03" % "test"

  testFrameworks += new TestFramework("com.iinteractive.test.sbt.Framework")
